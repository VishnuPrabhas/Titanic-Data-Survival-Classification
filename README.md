# Titanic-Data-Survival-Classification

The Data is taken from Kaggle and Exploratory Data Analysis is made on the data to know what information is it holding for us.
Then a dataset is prepared for our goal which is to classify the prople who survived or not according to the information available in the data.
After preprocessing and splitting the data into train-test, Logistic Regressio0n and KNN models are implimented to see how accurate our models are classifying the Survival data.
